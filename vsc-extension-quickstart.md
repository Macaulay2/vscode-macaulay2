# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.
* `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## To run a version of the package at all times without using F5

Step 1: Create a package file:
* Install vsce (VS Code Extension Manager) via `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
* Package your extension via `vsce package` (run this in the extension base directory)

This will create a file like `macaulay2-0.0.5.vsix`. This is the name of the package along with the version number.

Step 2: Install the package file:
you can install via `code --install-extension macaulay2-0.0.5.vsix` (again, this is in the extension base directory)

This should now be listed in your packages. Run `code --list-extensions` to see it. It will be named `m2.macaulay2` (as opposed to coreysharris.macaulay2). The publishers name comes first.

Now, all new sessions will come with your test package loaded. Making a new package and installing it will replace your current one with the new version. You might want to uninstall corey's package if you have some unexpected problems.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/vscode/vscode.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Extension Tests`.
* Press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded.
* See the output of the test result in the debug console.
* Make changes to `test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder.
  * By convention, the test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.
